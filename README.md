## Assignment 1 - Othello 
The purpose of the assignment was to give a deeper understanding of the alpha-beta pruning
search algorithm and how it can be implemented. The purpose was also to give an insight to
heuristic evaluation functions.

We built an othello-game where a human user plays against the computer. The computer always win.
